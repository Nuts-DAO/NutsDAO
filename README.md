About NutsDAO

## 1. NutsDAO Background
NutsDAO is a decentralized technology community formed by a group of developers, focusing on the construction and application development of the JuChain ecosystem.
The community is backed by the traffic and brand of JuCoin Exchange, the technical foundation of JuChain public chain and the ecological fund provided by JuCoin Labs, and has in-depth cooperation with blockchain associations of universities around the world to jointly promote developer cultivation and project implementation.
Vision: Transform the most cutting-edge ideas into sustainable on-chain productivity on JuChain, making this chain the most dynamic developer laboratory and innovation launch site.

## 2. Community Culture: Utopia of Madmen and Creators
Madmen vs. Reality
In the real world, "madmen" are often regarded as outliers, their ideas are considered unrealistic, and their creativity is bound by mainstream rules. But in NutsDAO, we believe:
- Innovators are always crazy until their ideas change the world.
- Disruptors are always outliers until they create a new order.
- The world of code has no inherent authority, only verifiable logic.
This is a space for lunatics. We respect every wild idea, encourage every unconventional experiment, let creativity grow, and not be suppressed by centralized power.
Code is belief, creation is doctrine
At NutsDAO, we don't believe in empty talk. The real lunatics don't just talk, but change the world with practical actions.
Every member here is using code, art, design, operation, and community collaboration to promote the growth of DAO.
Our belief is creation, not complaining; coding, not arguing; execution, not waiting.
You can do it here:
- Free experiment - put forward your crazy ideas, and DAO funds will support your experiments.
- On-chain collaboration - whether you are a developer, designer, musician, or economist, you can contribute in your own way.
- Decentralized autonomy - DAO has no CEO, and the direction of NutsDAO is determined by the community.
Failure is the nourishment of creation
- There is no word "failure" here, only evolution.
- Failed code will not be discarded, it will become the basis for the next generation of more powerful code.
- Every attempt is part of the progress of Web3.
Real Nuts are not afraid of failure, but afraid of mediocre conformity.
The cultural gene of NutsDAO
Hacker spirit - discover problems, solve problems, challenge authority
Open source collaboration - share code, open resources, grow together
Fearless innovation - reject mediocrity, dare to try, overthrow the old order
Cultural creation - not only code, art, design, content are all part of DAO
Co-construction and co-governance - there is no leader, only contributors, DAO is maintained by all Nuts

## 3. Incentive Plan
The token pool in the plan is referred to as the Treasury
Initially allocated to 65% of Nuts tokens,

### I. Basic Model

- The total output of JuNode is 72,000 units of computing power per month;
- The computing power follows the total inflation;
- Ensure that all output computing power can be basically allocated every month;
- NutsDAO will allocate corresponding "computing power weights" based on the participation of members in DAO tasks;
- Each member will receive a monthly output share based on the proportion of their computing power in the total computing power.
### 2. How to obtain computing power
The basic rules are as follows:
This content cannot be displayed outside the Lark document for the time being
This content cannot be displayed outside the Lark document for the time being
✅ All computing power will be bound to the member UID to form an open and transparent computing power ranking system (which can be deployed in Notion or Lark forms);

### 3. Revenue distribution mechanism

- Fixed monthly output: 72,000 units
- Each member's income = personal computing power this month / total effective computing power × 72,000;
- Participation data is settled once a month, and the results are submitted to the execution node, and the JuNode system completes the distribution.

### 4. Initial incentive budget

- DAO sets the initial operation period (such as the first 3 months), and the monthly additional incentive budget:
- Additional rewards of 50~100U (USDT) per month are used to incentivize the top few members;
- Rewards can be used to pay key positions such as operators and tool developers.
